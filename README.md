Network engineers spend a large share of every change window and every P1 doing the
same three things: log in to a device, run a set of `show` commands, and read the
output. Automating that normally means writing and maintaining Python — a barrier
for the many engineers who are excellent at networking but do not script daily.

This project removes that barrier. It is a **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server**
that exposes **Cisco pyATS** operations as tools an AI assistant can call. With it
running, an engineer types *"run a detailed health check on iosv-0"* in GitHub
Copilot Chat, and the assistant calls a real, audited pyATS function that connects
over SSH, executes vetted commands, and returns the device output — no script
written, no credentials in the chat window.

The hard part of connecting an LLM to production-adjacent infrastructure is not the
plumbing, it is the blast radius. A model that can invent commands can invent
`write erase`. This server is therefore built around a **deny-by-default guardrail
layer**: every string the model produces is validated before it reaches a device,
configuration changes are disabled unless explicitly turned on, and a deny-list
blocks service-impacting commands outright. Those guardrails are unit tested and run
in CI without needing a device.

- **Technology stack:** Python 3.10+, Cisco pyATS/Genie with Unicon, the Model
  Context Protocol Python SDK, Cisco Modeling Labs (CML) for the topology, and
  VS Code with GitHub Copilot Chat as the MCP client.
- **Status:** 1.0.0 — Beta. Stable and usable for labs, demos and enablement
  workshops. Intended for lab environments, not production networks.
- **Devices tested:** Cisco IOSv and IOS XE nodes running in Cisco Modeling Labs.

## Use Case

**Problem.** Day-2 network operations are repetitive but not trivial. Gathering a
consistent health snapshot across devices, checking interface state after a change,
or capturing a running-config backup all require CLI access plus the discipline to
run the same commands the same way every time. Teams that solve this with scripts
end up with a library only a handful of people can maintain, and engineers who
cannot script are left waiting on those people.

**Solution.** Expose a small, deliberately narrow set of pyATS operations through
MCP, and let an AI assistant map plain English onto them. The assistant chooses
*which* tool to call; the server decides *what is allowed to run*. That split is the
point: the model provides the natural-language interface, the server provides the
determinism and the safety.

**Outcomes.**

| Outcome | Before | With this project |
|---|---|---|
| Health snapshot across a device | Manual CLI, inconsistent command set | One prompt, six standard commands, identical every time |
| Skill required | Python plus pyATS API knowledge | Plain English |
| Command safety | Whatever the operator types | Allow-list for reads, deny-list for writes, writes off by default |
| Auditability | Terminal scrollback | Structured tool calls logged to stderr |
| Onboarding a new engineer | Learn the script library first | Ask a question on day one |

**Benefits to the organisation.** Consistent pre- and post-change validation, fewer
outages caused by ad-hoc CLI work, faster onboarding, and an automation surface that
scales by adding devices to a testbed rather than by writing more scripts.

**Challenges solved during development.**

- *MCP stdio hygiene.* FastMCP uses stdout for protocol frames, so any stray
  `print()` or Unicon log corrupts the session. All connections use
  `log_stdout=False` and every log line goes to stderr.
- *Prompt-injection resistance.* Device output can contain text that looks like an
  instruction — an interface description is attacker-controllable. Commands are
  validated against an allow-list rather than a "looks dangerous" heuristic, and
  shell/CLI separators are rejected so a second command cannot be smuggled in.
- *Credential hygiene.* The testbed resolves credentials from environment variables
  with the pyATS `%ENV{}` markup, so no password is ever written into the repository,
  and the VS Code configuration prompts for it at runtime.
- *Session leaks.* Each tool opens and closes its own connection through a context
  manager, so a failed command never leaves a VTY line pinned.

**Ideas that would extend this.** Per-user role mapping so `apply_config` is limited
to specific engineers; Genie `learn`/`diff` snapshots for automatic pre/post change
comparison; a dry-run mode that returns the intended configuration for approval
before applying it.

## Installation (required)

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| Python 3.10 or later | `python3 --version`. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) |
| Git | [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) |
| An SSH-reachable Cisco device | A [Cisco Modeling Labs](https://developer.cisco.com/modeling-labs/) node, or a [DevNet Sandbox](https://developer.cisco.com/site/sandbox/) |
| VS Code | [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) |
| GitHub Copilot + Copilot Chat extensions | Installed from the VS Code Marketplace, with an active Copilot subscription |

pyATS is fully supported on Linux and macOS. On Windows, use
[WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install) — the Windows-native
commands below cover the repository tooling and tests, but device connections
should be made from WSL.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ranilf2005/cisco-pyats-mcp-network-automation.git
cd cisco-pyats-mcp-network-automation
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

**Linux / macOS / WSL**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This installs the MCP SDK and `pyats[library]`, which includes the Genie parsers and
the Unicon connection library. Verify pyATS:

```bash
pyats version
```

### 4. Create your testbed

```bash
cp testbed/testbed.example.yaml testbed/testbed.yaml
```

Edit `testbed/testbed.yaml` and set the device name and `os` to match your lab. The
file contains **no credentials** — it references environment variables through the
pyATS `%ENV{}` markup. `testbed/testbed.yaml` is git-ignored.

Validate it:

```bash
pyats validate testbed testbed/testbed.yaml
```

### 5. Provide credentials through the environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your lab values, then load it:

**Linux / macOS / WSL**

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
Get-Content .env |
  Where-Object { $_ -notmatch '^\s*#|^\s*$' } |
  ForEach-Object { $k,$v = $_ -split '=',2; [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable($k,$v) }
```

`.env` is git-ignored. Enter the management IP address on its own — no `https://`
prefix and no trailing slash. For example `192.0.2.10`.

### 6. Run the pre-flight check

```bash
python scripts/check_env.py
```

This confirms that the dependencies import, the testbed file resolves, and the
credential variables are set. Fix anything it reports before continuing.

---

## Configuration (optional)

All configuration is supplied through environment variables, so the same code runs
in a lab, in CI, or under an MCP client without edits.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PYATS_TESTBED` | `testbed/testbed.yaml` | Path to the pyATS testbed file. Use an absolute path when launching from an MCP client. |
| `PYATS_MCP_ALLOW_CONFIG` | `false` | Master switch for `apply_config`. While `false`, the server is strictly read-only. |
| `PYATS_MCP_ALLOW_SAVE` | `false` | Additionally required before `write memory` is permitted. |
| `PYATS_MCP_ALLOWED_DEVICES` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated allow-list of device names. Empty means every device in the testbed. |
| `PYATS_MCP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` | `60` | SSH connection timeout in seconds. |
| `PYATS_MCP_COMMAND_TIMEOUT` | `120` | Per-command execution timeout in seconds. |
| `PYATS_MCP_MAX_OUTPUT_CHARS` | `60000` | Caps a single tool response so long output cannot exhaust the model context. |
| `PYATS_MCP_INSECURE_SSH` | `false` | Set to `true` to disable SSH host key verification. Throwaway labs only. |
| `PYATS_MCP_KNOWN_HOSTS` | *(system default)* | Custom `known_hosts` file used when host key verification is enabled. |

Device credentials are separate and are consumed by the testbed:
`CML_DEVICE_IP`, `CML_DEVICE_USERNAME`, `CML_DEVICE_PASSWORD` and
`CML_DEVICE_ENABLE_PASSWORD`.

### Wiring the server into VS Code

```bash
cp .vscode/mcp.json.example .vscode/mcp.json
```

Edit `.vscode/mcp.json` and set `command` to the Python interpreter inside your
virtual environment:

- Linux / macOS / WSL: `${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python`
- Windows: `${workspaceFolder}\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe`

The template uses a VS Code `promptString` input, so the device password is typed
into a masked prompt at start-up rather than being stored on disk. `.vscode/mcp.json`
is git-ignored.

Reload VS Code, open Copilot Chat, switch to **Agent** mode, and confirm that
`cisco-pyats-mcp` appears in the tools picker. VS Code will ask you to trust the
server because it executes local code — only trust servers you have reviewed.

---

## Usage (required)

### Run the server directly

```bash
python -m mcp_server
```

The server speaks MCP over stdio and produces no stdout output of its own; start-up
information is written to stderr. Normally you let VS Code launch it rather than
running it by hand.

### Verify connectivity without MCP

Run a command against a device using the same code path the server uses. This is the
fastest way to separate a connectivity problem from an MCP problem:

```bash
python scripts/run_show.py --device iosv-0 --command "show ip interface brief"
```

Both scripts print full usage with `--help`, and with no arguments at all:

```bash
python scripts/run_show.py --help
python scripts/check_env.py --help
```

### Tools exposed to the AI assistant

| Tool | Changes device state | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `list_devices` | No | Lists the testbed devices this server may reach. |
| `run_show_command` | No | Runs one validated `show` command. |
| `health_check` | No | `basic`: version and interface state. `detailed`: adds CPU, memory, routing summary and recent logs. |
| `backup_running_config` | No | Returns `show running-config` for offline backup or diffing. |
| `apply_config` | **Yes** | Applies configuration lines. Refuses to run unless `PYATS_MCP_ALLOW_CONFIG=true`. |

### Example prompts in Copilot Chat

Open Copilot Chat in **Agent** mode and ask:

- *"Which devices are available through the pyATS MCP server?"*
- *"Run `show ip interface brief` on iosv-0 and tell me which interfaces are down."*
- *"Do a detailed health check on iosv-0 and summarise anything that looks abnormal."*
- *"Back up the running configuration of iosv-0 and tell me whether any interface is
  missing a description."*

Copilot calls the matching tool, VS Code shows you the tool invocation for approval,
and the device output is returned into the conversation for analysis.

### Making a configuration change (opt in)

Configuration is disabled by default. Enable it only against a lab device you own:

```bash
export PYATS_MCP_ALLOW_CONFIG=true
export PYATS_MCP_ALLOWED_DEVICES=iosv-0
```

Restart the server, then ask Copilot to apply this loopback to `iosv-0`:

```text
interface loopback123
 description created-by-copilot-mcp
 ip address 10.123.123.1 255.255.255.255
```

Verify the result with a read-only call:

- *"Run `show ip interface brief | include Loopback123` on iosv-0."*

Commands such as `reload`, `write erase`, `erase`, `format`, `delete`,
`boot system`, `config-register`, `crypto key zeroize`, local `username` changes and
`no ip ssh` are rejected by the server even when configuration is enabled.

### Running the tests

The guardrail tests need no device and no pyATS installation:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest -q
ruff check .
bandit -r mcp_server scripts -q
```

## Related Sandbox

No hardware is required. Both of these give you SSH-reachable Cisco devices:

- [Cisco DevNet Sandbox catalogue](https://developer.cisco.com/site/sandbox/) —
  reserve or use an always-on IOS XE sandbox, then put its address and credentials
  in `.env` and point `testbed/testbed.yaml` at it.
- [Cisco Modeling Labs](https://developer.cisco.com/modeling-labs/) — build the
  IOSv topology used throughout [docs/lab-guide.md](docs/lab-guide.md).

When using a shared sandbox, keep `PYATS_MCP_ALLOW_CONFIG=false` so the server stays
read-only.

## Known issues

- **Windows-native pyATS.** pyATS is supported on Linux and macOS. On Windows, run
  the server inside WSL 2. The repository's tests and linters run natively on
  Windows.
- **One command per call.** `run_show_command` deliberately accepts a single `show`
  command with at most one pipe modifier. Ask for several commands and the assistant
  will make several tool calls.
- **Connection cost.** Each tool call opens and closes its own SSH session, which
  favours safety over speed. A multi-command request takes a few seconds per call.
- **Deny-list, not authorisation.** The configuration deny-list is a safety net. Real
  authorisation must be enforced on the device with AAA and command authorisation.
- **Genie parsing not yet exposed.** Tools return raw CLI text. Structured
  `genie parse` output is on the roadmap.
- **Sensitive output.** Device output returned to the assistant may include
  addressing and routing detail. Do not point the server at devices whose
  configuration must not leave your environment.

## Getting help

1. Run `python scripts/check_env.py` — it diagnoses most setup problems.
2. Confirm pyATS itself works:
   `python scripts/run_show.py --device <name> --command "show version"`.
   If that fails, the issue is connectivity or credentials, not MCP.
3. If the tools do not appear in Copilot Chat, check that `.vscode/mcp.json` is
   valid JSON, that `command` points at the interpreter inside `.venv`, and that all
   paths are absolute. Then inspect the MCP server output in the VS Code Output
   panel.
4. Review the troubleshooting sections of
   [docs/lab-guide.md](docs/lab-guide.md) and
   [docs/mcp-config-explained.md](docs/mcp-config-explained.md).
5. Still stuck? [Open an issue](https://github.com/ranilf2005/cisco-pyats-mcp-network-automation/issues/new/choose)
   using the bug report template, or ask in the
   [Cisco DevNet Community](https://community.cisco.com/t5/developer-hub/ct-p/4409j-developer-home).

## Getting involved

Contributions are welcome. The areas that would benefit most right now:

- **New read-only tools** — BGP neighbour verification, OSPF adjacency checks,
  interface error counters.
- **Genie integration** — expose `genie learn` and `genie diff` so pre- and
  post-change snapshots can be compared automatically.
- **Broader platform coverage** — NX-OS and IOS XR testbed examples and tests.
- **A dry-run mode** for `apply_config` that returns the intended change for
  approval before it is applied.

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the development setup, the checks to run
before opening a pull request, and the rules every new MCP tool must follow. All
participants are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
